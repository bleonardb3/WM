Use IBMâ€™s Watson Studio to create machine learning models and applications. Participants will be led through three labs. Each lab will use the Titanic data set, a common one used in Kaggle competitions.  

1. [Lab-1](https://github.com/bleonardb3/WM/tree/master/Lab-1) - The first lab will use the Watson Machine Learning capability to create a machine learning model based on the Titanic data set. The model will be deployed in Bluemix, and an application will be built that uses the deployed machine learning model to predict survivability given passenger characteristics. 

1. [Lab-2](https://github.com/bleonardb3/WM/tree/master/Lab-2) - The second lab will guide participants in using the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines.

1. [Lab-3](https://github.com/bleonardb3/WM/tree/master/Lab-3) - The final lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) in a Jupyter notebook to predict survivability using pyspark and a supervised learning model.
